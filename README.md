# simple-api-symfony

## Pre-requisites

* PHP v7.1.3+
* Composer v2.0.7+

## Used Libraries

It was necessary to install some packages to work with makers, since symfony/skeleton is cleaner.

* [Maker-Bundle](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/SymfonyMakerBundle/index.html) to handle certain types of creations.
* [Doctrine](https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/orm) to quickly manipulate the database.
